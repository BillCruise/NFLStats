NFL 2014 scores and schedule downloaded from http://www.scoreboard.com/nfl/results/

Teams, wins, losses, ties, and win % were downloaded from NFL 2014 standings. The full 2014 schedule with scores was downloaded from ScoreBoard.com to come up with the breakdown of how teams did against winning/losing teams.

Opp Wins - Total wins by all of each team's opponents.

Opp Losses - Total losses by all of a team's opponents.

Opp Win % - Opposing teams win percent. Denver, New England, Seattle, and Arizona are the only playoff teams whose opponents were above .500. Oakland was the overall leader in this category, but their opponents benefited from getting to play Oakland (sorry Raiders fans).

The next few columns tell how each team did against teams with a winning (above .500) record or losing (.500 and below) record.

Q Wins - Quality Wins are wins against teams with a record above .500.

Q Losses - Quality Losses are losses to teams with a record above .500.

Q Win % - Q Wins / (Q Wins + Q Losses)

B Wins - Bad Wins are wins against teams with a record of .500 or below.

B Losses - Bad Losses are losses to teams with a record of .500 or below.

B Win % - B Wins / (B Wins + B Losses)
